**Track:** Wallet Risk Classification

**Description:** Participants were asked to build a machine learning model to classify crypto wallets as safe, risky, or dangerous based on on-chain activity.

They developed a powerful solution leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze complex wallet interactions, applied Representation Learning to extract deep insights from DEX swaps, NFT transfers, crypto transactions, and contract interactions, and integrated Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZkML) to enable privacy-preserving computations.

On top of that, they tackled fake multisig wallet transactions, adding an extra layer of security. The result was Best-in-class accuracy in detecting scam transactions and identifying high-risk wallets—a critical need as crypto scams continue to rise.
